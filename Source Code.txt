Hello!
Thanks for downloading the Source Code for Break Arcade Games Out!
I hope you find this educational and entertaining.
The license is: do whatever you want with it. :)


You can watch several tutorials about this game and its source code on my Youtube Channel:

To build it:
If you are on Windows, open a Developer Console for Visual Studio (a console you can call the cl command) and just run the build.bat inside the code folder.
The executable will be created on the build folder. You should run it from the base directory (not inside the build folder).

I hope this is useful to you.
Best,
Dan Zaidan
